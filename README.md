### Hi, I'm Fei Zhao! 👋  

#### About Me  
I am a **Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science** at **[The University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB)](https://www.uab.edu/)** with a **4.0 GPA**, specializing in **Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs)**, **Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT)**, **Cross-Modal Generation**, and **Multimodal Fusion**. With **14 years of experience** in both research and engineering, I have published **16 papers** (13 as the first author) in top-tier venues such as **ACM CIKM, IEEE ICME, ACM SIGSPATIAL, and ACM Computing Surveys**.  


#### 🔬 Research & Projects  
- **Mitigating Hallucinations in Vision-Language Models** – Developing reinforcement learning-based test-time adaptation to reduce hallucinations in multimodal models.  
- **CheckGuard** – Created a large-scale cross-modal dataset for **stolen check detection** and **information extraction**  using **Vision-Language Models (VLMs)**.  
- **Remote Sensing & Disaster Assessment** – Designed a **visual prompt learning** approach for post-disaster damage evaluation, surpassing state-of-the-art methods.  
- **AI for Election Security** – Built a **Siamese Transformer-based model** for **ballot fraud detection**, contributing to a **$1.2M NSF grant**.
