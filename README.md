Hi, I’m Fei Zhao! 👋

About Me

I am a Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science at The University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) with a 4.0 GPA, specializing in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT), Cross-Modal Generation, and Multimodal Fusion. With 14 years of experience in both research and engineering, I have published 16 papers (13 as the first author) in top-tier venues such as ACM CIKM, IEEE ICME, ACM SIGSPATIAL, and ACM Computing Surveys.

🔬 Research & Projects
	•	Mitigating Hallucinations in Vision-Language Models – Developing reinforcement learning-based test-time adaptation to reduce hallucinations in multimodal models.
	•	CheckGuard – Created a large-scale cross-modal dataset for stolen check detection and information extraction using Vision-Language Models (VLMs).
	•	Remote Sensing & Disaster Assessment – Designed a visual prompt learning approach for post-disaster damage evaluation, surpassing state-of-the-art methods.
	•	AI for Election Security – Built a Siamese Transformer-based model for ballot fraud detection, contributing to a $1.2M NSF grant.

🌱 Currently Working on	
  •	Vision-Language Models Hallucination Mitigation
  •	Vision-Language Models chain of Thought (CoT) 
	•	Advanced Deep Multimodal Data Fusion techniques
	•	Efficient adaptation of Vision-Language Models
